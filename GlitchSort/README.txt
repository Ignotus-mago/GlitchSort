GlitchSort for Processing 2.0
Repository for Eclipse IDE
Created by Paul Hertz

You will need to include the following Processing 2.0 libraries in your Eclipse Java project:

	/GlitchSort/core.jar
	/Users/paulhz/Documents/Processing/libraries/controlP5/library/controlP5.jar
	/Applications/Processing 2/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/modes/java/libraries/minim/library/minim.jar
	/Applications/Processing 2/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/modes/java/libraries/minim/library/jsminim.jar
	/Applications/Processing 2/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/modes/java/libraries/minim/library/tritonus_share.jar
	/Applications/Processing 2/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/modes/java/libraries/minim/library/tritonus_aos.jar
	/Applications/Processing 2/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/modes/java/libraries/minim/library/mp3spi1.9.4.jar
	/Applications/Processing 2/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/modes/java/libraries/minim/library/jl1.0.jar

Your pathnames are probably going to be somewhat different.
